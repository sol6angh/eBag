        <h2><b>About Us</b></h2> <br>
        <h5> My e-bag website system is developed by 
        three senior year students from the faculity of Computing and Information Technology under 
        the Information System Department at King Abdulaziz University. My e-bag is a website created for the most part to university students because we (the creators) struggled at the start of our academic journey and now we try to solve this problem for the next generations to come, this website will help solve their problems in a fast and efficient way, it contains a lot of courses materials from around the universities in the middle east.
        Not only students who can benefit from the website also anyone who's good at a particular course can create a training questions or preparation for exam file and sell it, which will financially benefit the seller as well as the students who need this exact material.
        There are many features the users can use to find what will help them and suits them as the same time such as search bar, rating system, live chat amongst many more.
        Note: we do not encourage cheating in any way or form, for the most part, we only provide previously used materials so the students can gain valuable knowledge and understated how it works and then they create their own version of it, this website was created to help students legitimately not to help them cheat.
        If a small group of students ignored the past note and the very clear disclaimer inside every material page they will get caught because of 2 reasons:
        <br>1- All universities have an archiving system were if someone submitted a material it will be there forever and if another student tries to submit the same exact material later, he/she will get cheating.
        <br>2- Even if the archiving system didn't work, a few students will buy the same material and if they all submit it, all of them will get cheating for submitting the same material.</h5>
